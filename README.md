# Phishing Website Detection Using Machine Learning

### My Independent Project for MSc Graduate

## About
This project implements a machine learning solution to detect phishing websites using the CRISP-DM methodology. It includes building a Flask API and deploying the application with Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
- **Dataset:** The project uses the [Phishing Site URLs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taruntiwarihp/phishing-site-urls) from Kaggle

## Key Highlights
- 📊 Feature Analysis: Focused on domain names as key features and used Snowball Stemmer to remove http://, https://, and www.
- 🧠 Machine Learning Models: Trained and evaluated with Ensemble Method
- 🛠️ Technology Stack: Python, scikit-learn, Natural Language Toolkit, flask , Steamlit
